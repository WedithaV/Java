Single-Level Inheritance: A child class inherits from only one parent class. 
Example: Class B inherits properties and methods from Class A.

B -> A


Multi-Level Inheritance: A chain of inheritance where a class inherits from a derived class, 
forming multiple levels. Example: Class C inherits from Class B, which inherits from Class A.

C -> B -> A

Multiple Inheritance: A class inherits from more than one parent class. Java doesnâ€™t support 
this directly due to complexity but achieves it with interfaces.

A <- C -> A
