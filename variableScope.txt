Local variables are declared inside methods, constructors, or blocks.
They have a limited scope (only within the block where they are defined) 
and must be initialized before use.

Global variables in Java are represented by instance variables and class 
variables:

Instance variables are defined at the class level (but outside methods) and 
belong to a specific object.

Class variables (marked as static) are shared among all instances of a class.

Local variables exist temporarily, while instance and class variables exist 
for the lifetime of the object or class, respectively.
